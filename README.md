# "VoiceUpdates" app widget for Monday.com

Monday.com board widget app that allows users, by using Browser built-in Text-To-Speech engine, listen for updates in realtime.
(with some limitations!)


# Introduction

This is my entry in "Monday apps Challenge"
it's called "VoiceUpdates". It is board widget, that track changes of your data and it speak actual data that changed.
I saw requests from users to enrich current notifications system, so I created this App.
Nowadays simple sound notification doesn't do much help - users are overloaded with those simple "check me!" sound.
VoiceUpdates allows user to get valuable info almost instantaneously.
I also think it would help teams within open office where sound could be broadcasted to several people at once
Another thing - my app could help users with disabilities.

No third-party services for voice used, so no messing with API-keys/generation-download-wait-time and stuff like that.


# Features

* **Speak realtime updates**: as long as app is active!
* **Data added/updated**: only those events. But you can use Filters to have some customizations
* **Fine-tuning**: choose columns. Configure what fields to speak, type of Source to speak. More to come
* **Easy to use**: not much in UI, just install and launch!

# Current Limitations
didn't tested much on MacOs and didn't tested on mobile browsers.
Tested on Windows 10 Chrome/Firefox/Edge - all good.

# Future Plans
* **more events**: data delete/move/archive/rename
* **bug fixing**: yup
* **internationalization**: user could choose lang for different triggers
* **more templates**: in resulting text to speak
